      My first Saturday at Maker Prep. And we jumped right into JAVASCRIPT! Finally.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was pretty much a warm-up("warm-up";)) and the foundation to Javascript. Learned about variables, math keys, alerts, prompts, and console functions. Learned a TON today. I've done a bunch of javascript stuff online, but being in the class was really eye opening. There are just things that you can't get a feel for in a video. Videos don't really teach you. Like the Google Chrome console developer tool. WOW. Really cool stuff done all with a web browser. What else... Oh IMPLEMENTING Javascript into a website. I cannot believe that I did not learn that yet. It makes a lot of sense popping it into the HTML. That was really cool and again I've done like 3-4 other online beginner prep for JAVASCRIPT and they did not teach that. </p>
    <p>
      We also got into grids/columns/rows on <strong>BOOTSTRAP</strong> which is one thing that I was having trouble(or that I didnt want to deal with in Advanced CSS). Awesome stuff. It's really become eye opening checking out other websites. The "three column style" when switching from mobile to desktop is pretty damn popular, and now I know where it comes from! BOOTSTRAP.
    </p>
    <p>
      All in all, today was a great day. Except I got a ticket...   think I am going to be parking at the library from now on. BTW This was my second ticket...IN THE FUCKING FIRST WEEK. But I am learning Javascript, so I got that going for me.

  <h2 class="daytitles">Day 1, 2, and 3.</h2>
  <div class="blogposts">
    <p>So far so good.</p>
    <p>
      Today is day 3. Things have been pretty relaxing. Nothing's been overwhelming.
    </p>
    <p>
      On day 1, we finished up markdown files, which seemed completely usesless. Except for the fact that github only allows markdown files to be displayed. Which is why I think we did it. Not sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 2nd day, we started on HTML and the beginning of CSS. Wasn't too slow. Learned some neat tricks with atom. Wrote a little about myself. Made it look like a geocities website. Pretty Sweet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Which brings us to day 3. CSS advance. Boxing. From what I've read online and many of courses explain, boxing is quite important. So I am going to be boxing all of this to make it look really nice.
    </p>
    <p>
      So from now on I will be writing my blog posts here.

      Well that got confusing real fast. Day 4 is CSS positioning. Things got better when they told us about <a href="http://learnlayout.com/">this website</a> which helped visualize things better. Im curious to know how much bootstrap will assist with learning all of this positioning. It doesn't seem bad, but it seems really tedious to be sorting all of the boxes and layouts. I am really excited about bootstrap because it just seems like the shortcut to HTML and CSS.<div class="myimage"><img src="" alt="" height=100px ><p>  POSITIONING</p></div>
    </p>
    <p>
      I do understand why they are teaching all this. They say in Post that you need to know the long way before you can use the short way. Something that I've had personal experience with. I ain't mad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Updated my blog page looking less like a geocities website. But damn is it plain. It is not easy to make a beautiful website.

array methods worth noting
figure out


Push - groceryList.push("milk")  - ADDS TO THE END OF THE ARRAY.

UnShift - groceryList.unshift("pizza") - ADDS TO THE BEGINNING OF THE ARRAY


pop - REMOVED THE LAST ELEMENT OF THE ARRAY. You can then create a new element with the removed element by adding it to a variable. Like this.

var lastEl = groceryList.pop()
console.log(pizza)


Shift - grocery.List.shift() - REMOVED THE FIRST ELEMENT OF THE ARRAY. You can then create a new element with the removed element by adding it to a variable. Like this.

var firstEl = groceryList.shift()
console.log(pizza)

  Now, this is a story all about how
  My <span id="noun1"></span> got flipped-turned upside down
  And I'd like to take a minute
  Just sit right there
  I'll tell you how I became the <span id="noun2"></span> of a town called Bel Air

  In west <span id="place1"></span> born and raised
  On the playground was where I spent most of my days
  <span id="verb"></span> out maxin' relaxin' all cool
  And all shootin some b-ball outside of the school
  When a couple of <span id="noun3"></span> who were up to no good
  Started making trouble in my neighborhood
  I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
  She said 'You're movin' with your <span id="noun4"></span> and uncle in Bel Air'

  I whistled for a cab and when it came near
  The license plate said fresh and it had <span id="noun5"></span> in the mirror
  If anything I could say that this cab was rare
  But I thought 'Nah, forget it' - 'Yo, home to <span id="place2"></span>'

  I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8
  And I yelled to the cabbie 'Yo home <span id="verb2"></span> ya later'
  I looked at my kingdom
  I was finally there
  To sit on my throne as the <<span id="noun6"></span> of Bel Air

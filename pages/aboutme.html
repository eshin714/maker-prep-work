  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    My name is Eric! I am a sound designer/editor and I work at Therapy Studios. I have a bachelors in Management which has nothing to do with the field I am in! Im pretty good with Pro Tools and have lots of knowledge about audio in general. I've also been apart of an Emmy Award winning TV Show!
  </p>
  <p.>
    My favorite foods include
      <ol>
        <ul>Spaghetti</ul> <ul>Sushi</ul>
        <ul>Korean food<ul>
      </ol>
    Which makes sense because I'm Korean! <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Flag_of_South_Korea.svg/225px-Flag_of_South_Korea.svg.png" alt="" height="20px">

    <img src="http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/leagues/500/nba.png?transparent=true" alt="" height="40px">A fun fact about myself is that I love basketball. The NBA to be more specific. I am die hard <em>Lakers</em> fan, but I love the league in general. I am always reading about past and present teams and players. I love watching NBA classics on NBAtv.

  <h2>Why I Want to Learn</h2>
  <p>
    Pretty much because it's the future.
  </p>
    <p>
      We are living in an age where we use our computers for everything! We walk around with computers in our <strong>POCKETS</strong>! How amazing is that! It is an exciting time in tech and there will be no end to the need of  smart programmers/coders. Living in this time EVERYTHING needs an app or a website or some form of digital tool to help people function.
    </p>

    <h2>Now I'm Here</h2>
    <p>
      I am here because I'd like a little more guidance in this big world of code/programming. I've done MANY internet code programs, including UDACITY, Codecademy, Code School, Tree House and a bunch of other sites.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these sites have been absolutley amazing and awesome guidance tools for the beginning of my understanding of code. But there is definitely something missing when taking an online course. I feel I would benefit from taking a course with like minded students and enthusiastic teachers.

      It seems like <img src="https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4218375?v=3&s=200" alt="" height="20px">aker Square is a great place to learn and grow as a coder/programmer.
